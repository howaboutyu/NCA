## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a Jax implementation of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) as described in [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/). The original implementation is in [Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/self-organising-systems/blob/master/notebooks/growing_ca.ipynb#scrollTo=4O4tzfe-GRJ7), and this project is a re-implementation in Jax. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you setup to train the model on your local machine.  



### Installing

#### Without docker 

Install the dependencies with pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install Jax refer to the [Jax documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)

#### With GPU docker 

This docker is based on the [nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:22.09-tf2-py](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/rel-22-09.html#rel-22-09) image. This image has CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN 8.6, ensure that you satisfy the [driver requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/rel-22-09.html#rel-22-09).


```bash
sudo make docker-build

# attach to the docker container
sudo make start-devel
```


#### üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

After installation run the tests with pytest

```bash
pytest
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To train the model run the following command

```bash
python main.py --config configs/growing_nca.yaml
``` 

### Tensorboard logging

In this project we use [TensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) was used. It logs the train/val losses, the training NCA state propagation as a gif and also the NCA propagation from the seed state. To view the logs run the following command

```bash 
tensorboard --logdir ./logs 
```
