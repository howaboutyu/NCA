## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project presents a Jax implementation of the Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) algorithm, based on the concepts outlined in the Distill paper [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/).  While the original implementation was developed using Tensorflow, this project serves as a re-implementation specifically tailored for Jax.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you setup to train the model on your local machine, preferably with a GPU. 



### Installing

#### Without docker 

To install Jax refer to the [Jax documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)

Install the other dependencies with pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### With GPU docker (recommended)

To build the Docker image and attach to it, run the following commands:


```bash
sudo make docker-build

# Attach to the docker container
sudo make start-devel
```


This docker is based on the [nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:22.09-tf2-py](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/rel-22-09.html#rel-22-09) image. It has CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN 8.6, ensure that you satisfy the [driver requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/rel-22-09.html#rel-22-09).



#### üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To verify if everything is installed correctly, you can run the following command to perform tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Training

To train the model run the following command

```bash
python main.py --config configs/growing_nca.yaml 
``` 

Configuration settings can be defined using YAML files. The default configuration file to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper can be found at `configs/growing_nca_with_damage.yaml`. For all the default configurations, please refer to nca/configs.py.

To specify your own target image, you can modify the `target_filename` field in the YAML file to the desired image filename. Please ensure that the image has an alpha channel.


### Inference

To perform inference on a trained model, execute the following command. 


```bash
python main.py --config_path=configs/growing_demo.yaml --mode=evaluate --output_video_path=demo.mp4
2023
```

Please ensure that you update the `weights_dir` field in the configuration file with the accurate path to the downloaded checkpoint. Additionally, specify the `output_video_path` to determine the location where the NCA propagation will be saved in video format.
